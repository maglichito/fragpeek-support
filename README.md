## 🛠 Troubleshooting & FAQ

### 1. Why is there no "Create Account" option?
Fragpeek is a dedicated client for the FACEIT platform. To ensure your stats, ranks, and match history are accurate and secure, we use **FACEIT Connect** for authentication. You must have an existing account at [FACEIT.com](https://www.faceit.com) to use the app.

### 2. I’m having trouble logging in.
Since Fragpeek uses FACEIT’s secure login portal, we do not store or manage your password. 
* **Forgot Password?** Please use the [FACEIT Password Reset tool](https://www.faceit.com/en/reset-password).
* **Login Loop?** If the login page keeps refreshing, try clearing your Safari browser cache or ensuring you aren't in "Private Browsing" mode, as this can block the authentication token.

### 3. My latest match stats aren't showing up.
We fetch data directly from the official FACEIT API. It usually takes **5–10 minutes** after a match concludes for the global API to update. If your stats seem stuck, try pulling down on the dashboard to trigger a manual refresh.

### 4. How do I switch to a different FACEIT account?
In top bar tap **Logout**. When you tap "Login" again, make sure you aren't automatically signed into your previous account by the browser; you may need to log out of FACEIT.com in Safari first.
